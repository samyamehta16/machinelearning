## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Google account to use Google Colab
- Basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter Notebooks

### Usage

1. Open Google Colab in your browser: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. Open the desired notebook from this repository:
    - [Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb](https://github.com/your-username/ml-practice/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb)
    - [Data_Visualization_Techniques.ipynb](https://github.com/your-username/ml-practice/blob/main/Data_Visualization_Techniques.ipynb)

3. Once the notebook is opened in Colab, you can run the cells directly. If you need to upload any datasets, you can use Colabâ€™s file upload feature.

## Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Models are trained on labeled data (input-output pairs) to predict the output for new inputs.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Models are trained on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Models learn to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane) that describes the relationship between the features and the target.

### Data Visualization

Data visualization is crucial in data analysis, enabling us to understand and interpret data by representing it graphically. Effective visualizations can reveal trends, patterns, and insights that might be missed in raw data.
